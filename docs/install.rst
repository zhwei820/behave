Installation
============

.. pypi-release:: behave
   :prefix: Download
   :class: note

Installing *behave* is a relatively simple process if you have `pip`_
installed:

   pip install behave

If you do not have `pip`_ installed then you might have easy_install
instead. In that case just substitute "easy_install" for "pip" in the above
command.

If you have neither then we highly recommend you get `pip`_.

If you are unwilling or unable to get `pip`_ then you may install *behave*
manually by following the download link above and grabbing the source
bundle. Once you have that you need to unpack it. Then, in the directory
created by the unpacking, run:

   python setup.py install
