behave is behaviour-driven development, Python style.

Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development
technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and
non-technical or business participants in a software project. We have
a page further describing this `philosophy`_.

*behave* uses tests written in a natural language style, backed up by Python
code.

To get started, we recommend the `tutorial`_ and then the `test setup`_ and
`programming interface`_ references.
