Welcome to behave!
==================

   :class: note

behave is behaviour-driven development, Python style.

Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development
technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and
non-technical or business participants in a software project. We have
a page further describing this `philosophy`_.

*behave* uses tests written in a natural language style, backed up by Python
code.

Once you've `installed`_ *behave* we recommend the `tutorial`_ and then the
`test setup`_ and `api`_ references, the page of `related`_ software
(things that you can combine with *behave*)
and finally the information on `how to use
and configure`_ the *behave* tool.

There is also a `comparison`_ with the other tools available.
