'''behave is behaviour-driven development, Python style

Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development
technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and
non-technical or business participants in a software project.

*behave* uses tests written in a natural language style, backed up by Python
code.

To get started, we recommend the `tutorial`_ and then the `test language`_ and
`api`_ references.
